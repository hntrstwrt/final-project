      <p><b class="firstword">Y</b>esterday, the Oakland-born-and-raised singer (and one of my top five artists I think can blow up within the year) Kehlani, officially dropped her debut mixtape Cloud 19 on her SoundCloud page. Her first single from the mixtape Get Away was well received and, in my eyes, set expectations for this project high. Armed with a powerful voice, and a refreshing sound, it only seemed right that I would given this mixtape a track by track review and in the end, rate it from 1-10. Will she live up to the hype or were expectations too high? Let’s find out.</p>

        1. FWU (prod. by Swagg R’Celious)</blockquote>
   
     
      <p>Right off the bat, I must say I love the instrumental. Swagg R’Celious went in. The feeling I got while listening to this was a late 90s/early 2000s R&B feel but with modern drums, and it’s pretty awesome. I dig the monotonous guitar sample and hard-hitting drums.To be honest, you really could picture someone rapping over this, but at the same time, Kehlani’s voice fit this instrumental perfectly.  “FWU” is Kehlani boasting that the reason her man “fux” with her is because of how loyal she is. I think that this song is a perfect starter for this tape. It’s a song that you can definitely vibe to, and if you really listen to it, you really can hear the talent in her voice. Her voice control, along with harmonies and melodies, are on point and clean. Definitely a strong start and I hope she keeps it up.</p>

    <blockquote>2. As I Am (prod. by Red Vision of the Midi Mafia)</blockquote>

    <p>The change of pace here came a bit quickly, but I guess that should be expected since the tape is only 8 songs. A bit on the slower side, “As I Am” has Kehlani flexing her vocal muscles over an instrumental that really puts the focus on her voice. The song speaks on being in love, and I feel that Kehlani and Red Vision captured that feeling perfectly. It has a “new summer love” type feel that I’m sure SO many teenagers can relate to. This is the joint you play in the car while driving to see your significant other. It may just be me, but I’m getting eerie Aaliyah vibes during the chorus, and once again (it seems like it will stay like this throughout the whole tape) a 90s R&B vibe with modern drums is present here as well. This is actually going better than even I expected.</p>

    <blockquote>3. Get Away (prod. by Jahaan Sweet)</blockquote>

    <p>This was the mixtape’s lead single so we’ve been able to listen to this for quite some time now. In context with the previous song, the transition is solid. For those that haven’t heard it yet, this song has Kehlani urging her lover not to let her love slip away. Along the same lines of “FWU”, “Get Away” is a song that bangs in your speakers. It features a catchy hook that you can sing along to, and so far, it seems like the right choice as the first single. “Get Away”, in my opinion, gives you what Kehlani is all about in a nutshell. Powerful voice, tight production, catchy hooks.</p>

       </div>
          <p>Rap was full of seemingly out-of-nowhere success stories last year, but the same was not true for R&B. As more types of music pilfer the genre's signature delivery -- and its singers -- for their own ends, it's tougher for R&B artists to stand out. Aspiring singers are beset by chic, Aaliyah-indebted pop like Banks and Broods, rappers crooning hooks, vocalists laying out powerful melismatic runs on EDM tracks. Even indie rock, which traditionally wanted nothing to do with R&B, now regularly borrows from the likes of Sade.</p>

          <p>But the ambitious, self-assured new album from the Oakland singer Kehlani, You Should Be Here -- a follow-up to the well-received Cloud 19 mixtape from 2014 -- suggests that R&B singers still have plenty to contribute. This is a concept album. It's an intense, focused exploration of all, or nearly all, the relationships the singer is involved in, both romantic and familial.</p>
            
        <p>Kehlani doesn't waste much time: after a short intro, she delivers the album's first cooed line, "I'm looking right at you, but you're not here," immediately suggesting the unknowability of intimacy. She's addressing a lover, but that line could apply to anyone with whom she is closely connected: siblings, parents or friends -- they're drifting apart, and she doesn't get why.</p>

          <p>Many of the songs on You Should Be Here channel the same heady mixture of longing and uncertainty. In "The Letter," Kehlani refuses to name a subject until the last possible moment. "Your words were supposed to get me through my heart ache," Kehlani sings. "Maybe I didn't deserve you. Maybe I just couldn't cure you." This could be about any betrayal or disappointment -- until she suddenly drills down into details more than 2/3 of the way through the song: "every girl needs a mother." "Wanted" describes a newly-made connection, possibly fresh love, but the vocabulary of spiritual uplift in the song comes straight from gospel, as if she's found religion. There's courage here in holding back, a defiant choice to keep things ambiguous.♦</p>

    <blockquote>4. Deserve Better (prod. by Tommy Hittz)</blockquote>

    <p>This is the first track on the mixtape that I’m not completely feeling 100%. With  Tommy Hittz providing a synth heavy instrumental, “Deserve Better” is about, you guessed it, Kehlani “deserving” better. Now, don’t get my wrong, by NO MEANS am I calling this a bad song. To be completely honest, it’s still better than what most “R&B” is on the radio, but, compared to the other past 3 songs, this song just feels like a filler in some parts. I feel personally that Kehlani could’ve come harder vocally. When she really belts out those notes and vocal riffs is when her talent really shines. </p>

    <blockquote>5. How We Do Us (feat. Kyle Dion) (prod. Jahaan Sweet)</blockquote>

    <p>Let me keep it 100, after hearing the first 2 seconds of the song and hearing the classic “Thiss ishoww wedooo iiitt” lyrics by Montell Jordan I thought the song was about to be a party song, which, within those two seconds, I was pretty hype for. But alas, it was a essentially a duet between Kyle Dion and Kehlani crooning about how perfect their relationship is. Though I’ve never personally heard of him, Kyle Dion definitely impressed me with what he brought to the table. His voice and Kehlani’s had chemistry on this track that is evident. I would describe it as the happy version of “No Air” by Jordyn Sparks & Chris Brown. I’m starting to feel that Kehlani really shines on these “happy” songs instead of slower songs. Expect a few middle school couples to declare this as “their song” if this mixtape blows up.</p>

    <blockquote>6. 1st Position (prod. by Swagg R’Celious)</blockquote>

    <p>Seeing the title, I expected this song to almost be a girl’s version of “Take You Down” by Chris Brown. I guess, in a sense, it was. I think what makes this song very different from the rest though is that Kehlani is singing to another girl about getting with her. It’s a very blunt song as well, at least by this mixtape’s standards. Lines like “Say baby, stop messing with those boys get you a lady” over this darker (again, by this mixtape’s standards) instrumental give the song a very “alluring” feel. You can definitely see Kehlani talking to this girl, possibly in some type of club or whatever. It was a dope change of pace, and I think it will catch some people off guard. But overall, it was definitely put in the right place of this mixtape.</p>

    <blockquote>7. Act a Fool (feat. IAMSU!) (prod. by Prophit)</blockquote>

    <p>First impression of this track = hyphy. It has that whole Bay Area sound that artists like Sage the Gemini made popular. A simple synth backed up by an also simple drum pattern and a chorus with a lot of claps, this track has “party” written all over it. IAMSU! delivers a solid guest feature verse, and Kehlani somehow finds a way to make this song at least somewhat musical and (surprisingly) still shows off her talented singing ability in the chorus. Solid track. I do feel as though this could’ve been put somewhere in the middle (maybe between the 3rd and 4th song?) to give the mixtape a “refreshing” sound earlier than the 6th song.</p>

    <blockquote>8. Tell Your Mama (Prod. by Nate Fox + JP Floyd)</blockquote>

    <p>So here we are. The end. When I read the title I got a bit excited because I saw that Nate Fox produced it. Fans of Chance the Rapper know what he’s capable of and I was hoping that he would provide that type of feel on this song and thankfully he did! It’s a very musical/new age sounding instrumental that features Kehlani, for the first and only time on the mixtape, talking to the listener. It’s probably the most “happy” and “uplifiting” song on the mixtape. Kehlani urges listeners to tell their mothers and family “I love you” because without them, they wouldn’t be where they are now. Lyrics like “But what you must remember is those very first 9 months” will be sure to resonate with people who hear this song when they’re having a bad day. This was the best song to close with due to its message and feel. It left me feeling like we should appreciate each other more, and I’m sure many others felt the same. </p>

    –

      <p>There you have it. Overall, this was a strong, strong debut from Kehlani. Her sound is refreshing, and her talent is evident. There’s so much potential here. I feel that her momentum did die down a little bit in the middle but songs like “1st Position” helped it from completely losing momentum. My only gripe with this mixtape is that I wish it had been released in the beginning of the summer because most, if not all, of these songs have a summer vibe to them. Nonetheless, Kehlani proves to her critics and fans alike that she’s one artist that you definitely want to keep an eye on as the year progresses. Out of 10, I give Cloud 19 an 8.5 out of 10.♦</p>
